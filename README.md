# CacheSimulator
This cache simulator is used to strengthen conceptual knowledge about aspects of the cache which is essential to understanding how the cache works in an operating system. I expected to evaluate the cache of a given word address, in which we had to extract data, including the tac, set, block offset, and the byte offset.
